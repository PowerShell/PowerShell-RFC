# Path update for package installation

On Windows, when a user installs a tool using a package manager like WinGet or Chocolatey in
PowerShell, the tool is often added to the system or user PATH environment variable. However,
changes to PATH made during the installation process are not automatically propagated to running
PowerShell sessions or other active console applications. As a result, users frequently need to
start a new PowerShell session to recognize and use the newly installed command-line tools.

This behavior can be confusing and disrupts the workflowâ€”especially in automation scenarios or when
users expect tools to be immediately available post-installation. Addressing this limitation would
improve usability, align with user expectations, and reduce friction in both interactive and
scripted environments.

## Motivation

As a PowerShell user, I would like tools installed by `WinGet` or `Chocolatey` to be useable in my
current session so that I can use the new tool without interrupting my existing work in the current
session.

## User Experience

CMD suffered with the same problem and the Windows Terminal team already
[made a fix](https://microsoft.visualstudio.com/OS/_git/os.2020/pullrequest/10131240) to mitigate
the issue:

With this change, CMD will detect the execution of `winget.exe` and `choco.exe`, as well as other
package managers (the list is configurable in the registry given HKLM write permission). If we are
launching a package manager, we will save the current user and system `PATH` and diff them after the
package manager exits.

To make this safe, there are a couple caveats:

1. We will only detect changes to the BEGINNING or END of either `PATH` (user/system).

  ```pwsh
  ## We detect ';C:\Git'
  BEFORE: C:\Bin
  AFTER: C:\Bin;C:\Git
  ```

  ```pwsh
  ## We detect 'C:\Git;'
  BEFORE: C:\Bin
  AFTER: C:\Git;C:\Bin
  ```

  ```pwsh
  ## We detect nothing, as we cannot find 'C:\Bin' in the new path
  BEFORE: C:\Bin
  AFTER: C:\Git;C:\Foo
  ```

2. We will only ever **append** to CMD's current `PATH`.
3. This feature can be disabled by removing the list of package managers at
   `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor\KnownPackageManagers`.
4. This feature can be disabled by setting
   `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor\InteractiveExtensionLevel` to 0.
5.  This feature only activates if STDIN is a `Console`.

- This will only apply in the current shell and children.
- Batch files **run from an interactive shell** will detect package managers as well.
- This is going to help things like `install_all_my_packages.bat`.

## Specification

### What should align with CMD

PowerShell should align with the CMD behavior as much as we can:
- `NativeCommandProcessor` should also detect the execution of package managers defined in the list
  in registry
- If we are launching a package manager, we will save the user and system `PATH`, find the diff
  after execution, and update the process `PATH` accordingly.

More specifically, we should retain the following CMD behaviors:

1. Use the same registry key for the list of package managers to detect:
   `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor\KnownPackageManagers`.
2. Only detect changes to the BEGINNING or END of either `PATH` (user and system).
3. Only ever append to PowerShell's current `PATH`.
4. Can be disabled by removing the list of package managers from registry.

### What may be different

In CMD, the feature is enabled under the following conditions:

- CMD is running interactively
  - not running a single command or batch file via `cmd /c`
  - `stdin` is `Console`
- Registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor\InteractiveExtensionLevel` is >=1

  ```c
  // code snippet for checking if it's considered interactive. 
  if (!SingleBatchInvocation && !SingleCommandInvocation) {
      fIsInteractiveForExtensionPurposes = FileIsConsole(STDIN) ? TRUE : FALSE;
  }

  // code snippet for checking if package manager detection is on
  if (fIsInteractiveForExtensionPurposes && dwInteractiveExtensionLevel >= 1) {
      // code for detecting package manager
  }
  ```

In PowerShell, the concept of interactive/non-interactive is different from CMD. 

non-interactive in PowerShell (`pwsh -noninteractive`) is more like a restriction to script -- the
script should not expect to prompt user for input for things like `Read-Host`, `ShouldProcess`,
`ShouldContinue`, mandatory parameter input, and etc. 

An attempt to do so will result in an error and terminate the script, so that in an automation
environment, a script won't hang waiting for input. 

However, even in a non-interactive PowerShell session, user can still run commands interactively.

#### Discussion points

1. When PowerShell runs with `pwsh -c` or `pwsh -f` without the `-noexit` flag, it runs a single
   command or file and then terminates, which is very similar to the first _"CMD running
   interactively"_ check. So, should we disable the feature in this case?

   - [dongbow] IMHO, the feature is useful to script execution too. For example, a bootstrap script
     installs a tool and call it right after the installation is done. Today, the script will have
     to hardcode the tool's location or start another PowerShell process to continue the rest work.

2. Unlike CMD, PowerShell can be hosted in other applications, such as a GUI application which
   doesn't have a `stdin`. Will the feature still be useful in that case (`stdin` is not `Console`)?

3. The registry key `InteractiveExtensionLevel` is used in CMD for more than the package manager
   detection feature. It's also used to guard a "WingetCmdNotFound" feature. Should we also disable
   the feature based on this key?

   - Would it be reasonable to disable the feature in PowerShell but not in CMD?
   - [dongbow] IMHO, it should be OK for us to honor this key too. It seems not reasonable to have a
     separate way to disable this feature in PowerShell while keeping the feature on in CMD.

   ```c
   if (DosErr == MSG_DIR_BAD_COMMAND_OR_FILE) {
       if (Feature_WingetCmdNotFound::IsEnabled()) {
           if (fIsInteractiveForExtensionPurposes && dwInteractiveExtensionLevel >= 1) {
                // handle winget not found error specially
           }
       }
   } else { ... }
   ```

4. What about `Start-Process`, should we do the detection within that cmdlet too?

5. The fix to CMD checks command name only, so it will try refreshing `PATH` even if `winget` or
   `choco` are invoked for purpose other than installing a new package, e.g. `winget search`. Should
   we optimize it in PowerShell to only refresh `PATH` when `winget install` or `choco install`
   actually runs?

6. Refreshing PATH could cause a problem in command resolution -- a command that could be found in
   an unloaded module may be resolved to a native command due to the appending of a new path to
   `PATH`. How much should we care about this situation (it's an existing issue anyway)?

   - [dongbow] IMHO, this should not be a concern for script execution/automation, as it should use
     module-name-qualified command name. I also don't think it's a real problem to interactive usage
     -- if the user run `foo` after `winget install foo`, they would expect the installed tool to be
     invoked instead of a function named `foo` from an unloaded module.
