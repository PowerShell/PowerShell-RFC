# PowerShell User Content Location

This RFC proposes moving the current PowerShell user content location out of OneDrive to the AppData directory on Windows machines.

## Motivation

- PowerShell currently places profile, modules, and configuration files in the user's Documents folder, which is against established conventions for shell configurations and tools.
- PowerShell content files in OneDrive can lead to unwanted syncing of module files, leading to various issues.
- There is strong community demand for changing this behavior as the current setup is problematic for many users.
- Changing the default location would align PowerShell with other developer tools and improve usability.

    As a user,
    I can customize the location where PowerShell user content is installed,
    so that I can avoid problems created by file sync solutions like OneDrive.

## User Experience

- On startup PowerShell will create a directory in AppData and a configuration file.
- In the configuration file the user scoped PSModulePath will point to AppData/PowerShell/Modules.
- Users can opt out of this new location by specifying a desired user scoped module path in the configuration file.

## Specification

- The content folder location change will only apply to PowerShell on Windows.
- Configurability of the content folder will apply to all systems.
- This will be an experimental feature.
- The PowerShell user content folder will be located in the `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\PowerShell`.
- A configuration file in the PowerShell user content folder will determine the location of the user scoped PSModulePath.
- The user will be responsible for specifying thier desired install location using PSResourceGet.
- The location of Modules is configurable
- The location of this folder is not configurable.
- The proposed directory structure:

    C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\PowerShell\
    ├── PSContent                 (Configurable)
    └── PSModulePathConfig.json   (Not Configurable)

    PSContent                     (Configurable)
    ├── Scripts                   (Not Configurable)
    ├── Modules                   (Not Configurable)
    ├── Help                      (Not Configurable)
    └── profile.ps1               (Not Configurable)

- The configuration file:

  ```json
  {
      "UserPSContentPath" : "C:\\Users\\User\\PowerShell"
  }
  ```

## Alternate Proposals and Considerations

- The following functionalities will be affected:
  - SecretManagement
    - SecretManagement extension vaults are registered for the current user context in:
      `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\PowerShell\secretmanagement\secretvaultregistry\`

      When an extension vault is registered, SecretManagement stores the full path to the extension
      module in the registry. Moving the PowerShell content to a new location will break the vault
      registrations.
- Use the following script to relocate the PowerShell contents folder:

  ```pwsh
  $newPath = "C:\Custom\PowerShell\Modules"
  $currentUserModulePath = [System.Environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments') + "\PowerShell\Modules"
  Move-Item -Path $currentUserModulePath -Destination $newPath -Force
  ```
