Will DSC vNext support getting out the data only from gets (this helps make monitoring a lot easier, and yet it's something DSC hasn't exactly done in the past)?

[Thursday 9:47 AM] Ryan Yates (Guest)

Is the daily build still being released?

[Thursday 9:49 AM] Mikey Lombardi

Michael Greene (POWERSHELL)

For the first time ever, the tutorials are based on managing a fictional app, not just "set a registry key", etc


I spent years being frustrated by "how to write a resource" docs in CM tools always being too trivial (here's how you set a string in a fake file) or a real resource (here's how you write a resource to manage environment variables) - the former doesn't really help you understand what you're doing in detail, the latter leads to 100+ resources managing the same real-world component.


 

So the samples in that repo manage a fictional application's configuration file - a very common requirement, but one that won't collide with real-world usage.

 

There's also a contributor's guide with some specs - if you're comfortable programming in any language, I'd really like to get alternative implementations into the samples repo. You can contribute just the code, or code and tutorial - I'm happy to work with you on whatever! üíú

Will DSC vNext support getting out the data only from gets (this helps make monitoring a lot easier, and yet it's something DSC hasn't exactly done in the past)?


Do you mean just getting current state for a configuration document?


[Thursday 9:52 AM] Mikey Lombardi

DSCv3 supports retrieving the current state of every instance in a configuration document. You can use the dsc config get command for that:
