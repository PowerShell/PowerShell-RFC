## Notes

* Joey to follow-up on trying Teams meeting instead of live event
  (with public, non-federated accounts
* Definitely check out the [2021 roadmap blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-team-2021-investments/)
  for info about the themes and investments we're making in PowerShell, modules, and OpenSSH
  * Shipping in Microsoft Update is a big one to check out: we're working to make it easier to
    install and update PS7 on Windows 10 and Server machines
* Demo 7.2-preview.4: Updated formatting and output of errors and progress
  * Progress in window title!
* Demo: SecretManagement / SecretStore updates
  * SecretStore configuration can now be done non-interactively (especially for CI/CD systems)
    * In the past, manual interaction was required to set a SecretStore passphrase
    * Added a `-Password` parameter
    * These changes are in SecretStore 0.9.3 (aka RC3)
  * Metadata updates to both SecretManagement and SecretStore
    * Added an interface for secret metadata so that users can tag or annotate secrets
    * Metadata is optional for secret vault extensions to implement
    * End users can change a secret's metadata with `Set-Secret -Metadata`
      and view with `Get-SecretInfo` (and something like `Format-List` or `Select-Object`)
  * Getting very close to GA (keep your eyes pulled!)
* Dynamic help in PSReadline
  * F1 while typing to jump right into the full help for the cmdlet you're currently using
    (and right to the parameter your cursor is currently on!)
  * Q to quit and you're right back to where you were typing before
  * You can also use Alt+H if you just want some a summary of a cmdlet or
    parameter's syntax or description
  * For Predictive IntelliSense, you can use Alt+H to switch focus between "sample values" for
    predicted command parameters
  * macOS has some issues with the existing keyboard shortcuts, so
    [give us feedback](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine/issues/2242)!
* Docs update
  * Launched a new docset for "utility modules" that the PowerShell Team owns,
    but that don't ship in the PowerShell package
    * E.g. SecretManagement, PSScriptAnalyzer
    * Some of these are a WIP, but we'll be filling placeholders over time
    * We'll also be working to add additional modules to that docset
  * We've also been working closely with the Windows 10/Server documentation team
    to update Windows PowerShell updateable help for Server 2019 and 2022
* Demo from @JustinGrote: What's in my profile?
  * Hosted [here](https://github.com/JustinGrote/dotfiles) and using chezmoi for "deploying" them
  * Random tidbits
    * Put history in the same place for all PSReadline instances
    * Sets up Predictive IntelliSense for command completion
    * Tons of PSReadline key handlers for arbitrary PS scripts
      * E.g. F1 to open help in a browser or ShowWindow
      * Paste text as here-string
      * Toggle between quotes for a string
    * Set editor defaults for `code` or `nano` (former on Windows, latter on non-Windows)
    * Sets up default secrets with SecretManagement regardless of vault extension that's being used
    * Shorthand aliases e.g. for Terraform
    * Helper functions
      * Quick git commit and push
      * `bouncecode`
      * invoke web script
      * hop into the debugger
    * Fancy, context-aware prompt with emoji customizations
    * Use TLS 1.2 in Windows PowerShell
    * New PS7 ErrorView
    * If fancy PSReadline is installed, use Azure ML predictor
    * Turn on fancy progress indicator on new versions of PS7
  * Check out Justin's PowerShell Extension Pack for VS Code
    * Includes bracket colorizer
* Q&A
