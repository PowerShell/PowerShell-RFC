## Notes

* PowerShell 7.1 Preview 6 released this week
  * Noteworthy changes in [release blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-7-1-preview-6/)
  * One more Preview 7 planned for the first week of September to add some final feature code
  * Release Candidates planned for late September and October with GA in November
    * Plan is to only take very high-priority bug fixes in RC
  * Anything that doesn't make 7.1 will ship in 7.2
  * Decisions on which experimental features remain experimental in 7.1 in
    [this issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13406)
* Preview 6 has been officially submitted to the Microsoft Store
  * Several days to go through the certification process
  * We *believe* we've done the right things to be published, but we will see
* Totally hear @iSazonov's feedback on lack of roadmap and backlog of PRs
  * We're establishing Working Groups to decentralize management of `Area-*` labeled
    PRs and issues
* Semantic Highlighting in the PowerShell Preview extension for Visual Studio Code
  * Old syntax highlighting was based on regex, but it's limited in functionality
  * New syntax highlighting is using PowerShell's tokenizer
* Updates on the updateable help pipeline
  * Committed to continuing to improve the Update-Help system so that they see the same docs on the web and in the console
    * Fixes to Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.1
    * New internal CI/CD feature to accelerate adoption of new pipeline by partner
      teams in Windows and Office
    * If you see any issues in `Update-Help`, please file an issue in
      [PowerShell-Docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs)
* [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) updates
  * Now support running containers inside customers' virtual network
    * This means you can manage machines or Kubernetes clusters with private IPs 
    * Supported in a small handful of regions today, rolling out to more on an ongoing basis
  * Container image for Cloud Shell is now [open-sourced](https://github.com/azure/cloudshell)
    * PRs are open! Just make sure to check [Contributing in the README](https://github.com/azure/cloudshell#contributing)
* Notebook mode
    * Available in VSCode insiders today with the PowerShell Preview Extension
    * [Blog post is available](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/public-preview-of-notebook-mode-in-the-powershell-preview-extension-for-visual-studio-code/#:~:text=Notebook%20Mode%20only%20requires%20Visual%20Studio%20Code%20and,Mode%20also%20can%20open%20existing%20PowerShell%20scripts%20%28.ps1%29)
* DSC Changes
    * Now owned by Steve's team 
    * Moving away from MOF to json as the intermediary file type
    * Making changes in the PowerShell engine as well as in the module 
    * This feature will stay in experimental mode for 7.1
    * Support PowerShell classes and scripting 
    * Not dependent on LCM-- should be able to be more integrated with other tools
* Pester upgrade perspective
    * Long-term goal is to move to Pester 5 
    * This will take time due to breaking changes 
* PowerShell Core. Thoughts about adding the option to capture the WhatIf output like what was done with the Write-Host stream back in PS 5.1? PowerShell/PowerShell#9870 -- we will take a look at separately
* PowerShell VSCode extension. What is being worked on right now in term of bugs/stability/performance? tracked in [PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices#1295](https://github.com/powershell/PowerShellEditorServices#1295)
  * Today's hosting method is sub-optimal--we are re-doing this model currently
  * Take a look at the issue to see a detailed perspective on the changes being made
  * Hoping to get a preview out for this in the coming months (fairly large item)
  * GA timeline will be dependent on feedback from preview release
  * Goal is to not only improve reliability but supportability of the extension
* Request for YAML as a de-facto standard - PowerShell/PowerShell#3607 based on https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet
  * Currently there is no plan to make this change 
  * Direction for PowerShell is to modularize changes and encourage ecosystem usage 
  * In the future may even pull some features out of PowerShell into modules 
* Semver type and module system: PowerShell/PowerShell#2983 
  * Working closely with .NET team but this will not make it in .NET 5
* Is Cleanup{} in the plans for the next preview, or are we planning on having that pushed back to 7.2?
  * We hope so but if so it will likely be experimental 
  * If not in 7.1 it will ship in 7.2
* SecretManagement- we expect to have a new preview next week 
  * Includes big changes from community feedback and internal review 
  * Hope to move towards a GA release later this year 
* PowerShellGet 3.0- we expect to have a preview next week
  * We have also built a compatibility layer so that v2 scripts will continue to work
  * Plan to ship these both in the next PowerShell 7.1 preview release 
  * Will be looking for feedback to determine 7.1 plans for these modules
