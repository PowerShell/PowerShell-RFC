## Notes

* PowerShell 7.2 preview 8 coming out in the next week or so
  * JSON serialization DateTime fix no longer includes extended members
    * @Jaykul: Would be useful to also support auto-casting to `DateTimeOffset` when getting that
      from remote JSON
  * `$ErrorView = 'DetailedView'` will give you the full `Get-Error` output at failure time
    * this is great for CI/CD where the session is lost after execution is finished
  * `Get-Foo | Format-Table -View <tab>` now has proper completions,
    making formatter views more discoverable and potentially useful
  * Added colorization as an experimental feature to `Get-ChildItem` output
* Microsoft Update is now working as an opt-in for 7.2 preview customers
  * Resolved some minor issues during preview 7
  * You can still opt in via [these blog instructions](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/preview-updating-powershell-7-2-with-microsoft-update/),
    but you can also use the MSI now to  opt-in to both 7.2 updates and MU in general
* SecretManagement 1.1 going to GA this/next week after a small brekaing change preview from last month
  * Check out [this blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/secretmanagement-module-v1-1-0-preview-update/)
    for more info
* PowerShellGet 3.0
  * `Find-` has been merged in, `Install-` and `Save-` are going through bug bashes before we merge them
  * Expect a new preview within the next couple weeks
  * Working towards GA this year depending on feedback for backwards-compatibility to 2.x
* Crescendo preview 3
  * Will include breaking changes on schema updates in order to handle multiple command
    definitions within a single JSON
  * Better output parsing for creating objects from text
  * Adding native command elevation
* platyPS 2.0 preview 2
  * New release coming within the next couple weeks, look to blogs for new features
  * Used across Microsoft for 1st party modules, driving consistency in module reference documentation
* PSArm update
  * Working very closely with the Bicep team,
    we want to take advantage of their momentum as much as possible going forward
  * Will be sharing a blog update within the next couple weeks
* Demo: GitHub Copilot
* Update on Windows 11
  * No major changes from PowerShell on the first release
  * We are aggressively investigating and having discussions on how PowerShell 7 can be more inbox
    * Could be installed by default from Store
    * Investigating FoD
    * Dependent on our ability to make minimal PS7 small enough for Windows requirements
  * Updating PackageManagement and PowerShellGet will only happen after we've validated strong
    compatibility from 2.x to 3.x
