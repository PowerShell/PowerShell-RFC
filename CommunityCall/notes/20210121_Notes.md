## Agenda

* SecretManagement AKV demo (Sydney)
* SecretManagement and SecretStore 1.0 GA
* Update on blog comments (Sean)
* New PowerShell Team member
* Working Groups update (Joey)
* [Q&A](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/issues/275)

## Notes

* 7.0.4 and 7.1.1 servicing releases
  * 7.1.1 last week and 7.0.4 this week
  * Update!
  * Minor servicing releases
    * Bug fix on reparse points on Windows that prevented EXEs from running on
      network shares
    * Picked up the latest .NET Core builds with fixes (see their release notes)
* Skipping 7.2-preview release due to:
  * servicing release
  * holidays
  * low amount of feature PRs
* Expect next 7.2-preview in February
* SecretManagement Azure KeyVault (AKV) demo
  * SecretManagement already has a supported vault extension for AKV
  * Requires Az.Akv 3.3.0 or higher
  * Make sure your KeyVault already exists in Azure
    * SecretManagement is not intended for vault provisioning,
      just getting, setting, and removing secrets
  * A hashtable of `-VaultParameters` are sometimes required (e.g. with AKV) to
    pass additional metadata to the vault extension
  * File issues if you run into problems!
* SecretManagement and SecretStore 1.0 RC released this month
  * A few issues filed, but we think they're in good shape
  * Having internal conversations around a second RC with a secret metadata
    feature (issue [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/SecretManagement/issues/46))
  * GA approximated to come in Feb to March (depending on metadata feature)
* Update on PowerShell Team blog comments
  * Just went through an exercise in reviewing team blog comments to remove
    \>40 spam coments
  * Will be doing a better job going forward to keep that clean and up-to-date
* Welcoming Andy Schwartzmeyer as a new official member of the PowerShell Team
  * Andy was an early contributor to PowerShell on Linux (whoa, look at those commits!),
    and we're really excited to have him rejoin full-time
* Working Groups
  * Two PRs that you should review if interested:
    * https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/14603
    * https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/274
  * Initially, WGs will start with PowerShell Team members who are experts in
    specific areas
  * We will eventually accept community WG members as we validate the new
    engagement model
* Q&A
  * PowerShell Azure CDN distribution (as opposed to GitHub Releases for pwshup initiative)
    * `pwshup` is intended to install PowerShell regardless of which OS/distro you're on
    * We should be picking packages up from somewhere other than GitHub
      (folks can be blocked from accessing GitHub, and CDNs are faster across geographies)
  * PowerShell Native Host in Library (currently blocked on .NET team, but could solved in PowerShell).
    * Would love to get more info on *why* you're doing this
  * PowerShell Custom Transport Interface for 7.2 release (just want to make sure we have something before 7.2!)
    * Tentative plan to leverage subsystem work (currently being used for predicitions)
      as a way to pull out remoting transports as individual subsystems of Powershell
    * E.g. we could publish WinRM support as a subsystem on the Gallery
    * Can't commit directly to 7.2
  * Is $MyPullRequest going to be merged in 7.2 / the next preview ?
    * We have a 7.2 backlog queue marked by:
      * PRs have `Backport-7.2.x-Consider`
      * Issues have Milestone of `7.2-Consider`
    * Not committing to finishing these, but they are a higher priority among community issues/PRs
* Status update on [PowerShell EditorServices issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/1295#issuecomment-762935794)
  * Likely one of the core issues creating stability issues in the VS Code extension
  * We recognize that we owe the community a response and update on that timeline
  * Rob has had other obligations over the last couple months,
    and Andy will begin to ramp on the Editor Services and extension projects to help out
* `install-powershell.ps1` is slow to install latest release version because of lagged metadata update
  * Originally was for CI/CD pipeline, still not really intended for end-user usage
  * `pwshup` initiative is intended to be a more robust version of this
* Check out usage data at https://aka.ms/PSGitHubBI
  * Update to 7.1!
* We do plan to make native command line / shell improvements in 7.2
  * Improved argument parsing
  * `set -e` scenario: error on non-zero $LASTEXITCODE
* Sideline projects?
  * Maybe!
  * Always doing internal experiments
* Happy New Year!
