# PowerShell Community Call - May 20, 2021

## Agenda

* OpenSSH update
* Working Groups/Community update
* Crescendo preview 2
* SecretManagement 1.1 design change affecting extensions
* PowerShellGet v3 update
* Community Demos
* Q&A

## Notes

* OpenSSH
  * Originally planned to update to 8.1 in 20H1 (and then 20H2)
  * Due to mixups, this was delayed until the last month, upon which
    we shipped an 8.1 WU update for all machines downlevel to 20H1
  * 8.6 will be out as a GitHub release (beta) in the next few weeks
  * Due to the validation length of 8.6, it will not ship into 21H2,
    but instead will show up in 22H1 (or the equivalent)
  * Generally, the version of OpenSSH shipping in Windows is the only
    supported version
    * Installing "manually" from GitHub to downlevel is not a supported
      scenario
  * The Azure Gallery does have a supported extension for Azure Windows VMs
    or Arc-enabled servers
    * Currently on 7.7 but will be updating soon
* Working Groups / Community update
  * Working Groups are sub-committees around specific [issue labels](https://github.com/powershell/powershell/labels)
    in the PowerShell/PowerShell
  * Some of the feedback
  * https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/14603
  * https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/274
* Module compatibility
  * Lots of feedback around M365 module compatibility with PowerShell 7
  * Highly engaged and making progress
* Crescendo preview.2
  * Released last week, now with command elevation!
  * Flexibile enough to elevate on both Windows and Linux (`Start-Process` and `sudo`)
  * Some issues with [elevation on Windows](https://github.com/PowerShell/Crescendo/issues/81)
  * Next preview: plan to make improvements to output handling
* SecretManagement 1.1 design change for vault extensions
  * Vault extensions get registered with SecretManagement as implementations
    for retreiving and setting secrets in a vault
  * Today, these extension modules are loaded into the same session in which
    the user is executing
  * This design prevents vault extensions from operating in Constrained Language Mode (CLM)
  * Code Integrity (CI) policy is an application control policy that locks down a machine
    * Essentially runs "trusted" scripts/modules in full language mode vs. CLM
  * SecretManagement is designed to run in CLM but cannot today beause of how it loades
    extension modules today
  * Going forward, vault extensions will get loaded into fresh sessions via new runspaces
  * This change breaks extension modules like KeePass in how they unlock the vault
    * Unlocking can be done interactively (e.g. prompt for password),
      but it also needs to work in non-interactive (e.g. CI/CD) scenarios
  * Original issue (here)[https://github.com/PowerShell/SecretStore/issues/64],
    but conversation will continue [in SecretManagement](https://github.com/PowerShell/SecretManagement/issues/144)
* PowerShellGet 3.0 update
  * Despite lack of a major preview update, a ton of work has gone into
    PSGetv3 within the last month
  * Particularly getting into code review for `Find-Module`
  * Are also looking into issues and PRs across the board coming in from community
    * Keep playing with PSGetv3 and filing issues!
  * Not a firm date on next release, but would love to ship in June
* Microsoft/Community demos
  * Updates to Guest Configuration cmdlets (Michelle Yang)
    *
  * Gael Colas

  * Justin Grote?
