## Notes

* PowerShell 7.2 preview 3 release
  * Released 2 days ago (2/16)
  * Marks the first release with .NET 6 (preview 1)
* New progress bar demo
  * Renders much faster than the existing graphical progress bar
  * Width, color, and style (e.g. italic) now customizable
  * Old progress bar still available as "classic"
  * Just like existing implementation today and not shown in transcript
  * No styling on top because of security presenting access to console buffer on non-Windows
    * Could potentially look into re-adding on Windows, but not a priority today
* DSC for PowerShell 7
  * Scoped entirely to Get-DscResource, Invoke-DscResource and Configuration compilation
  * We do not currently have plans for an LCM, pull server, or Configuration execution
* New Community blog
  * Sean Kearney has been keeping the lights on with the Hey, Scripting Guy! blog since
    Ed Wilson retired
  * Huge shout-out to Thomas Lee (@doctordns) who reached out to offer time to revitalize old
    Hey, Scripting Guy posts and write new ones
  * New community blog moved to GitHub and redesigned around community contributions
    * You can contribute posts, edits, and ideas directly via GitHub
* @SQLVariant / Aaron Nelson on managing PowerShell and SQL Notebooks
  * Check out Doug Finke's [PowerShellNotebook module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PowerShellNotebook/)
  * SASS cmdlets in SqlServer module also working in PS7 now!
* Demos from outside the PowerShell Team
  * Today, if you're interested, post in the Q&A issue thread on PowerShell-RFC repo for
    the community call you'd like to present in
* @adamdriscoll on a terminal UI (TUI) designer
  * Many PowerShell "UIs" use `gui.cs` as a cross-platform TUI library
  * TUI designer generates gui.cs-based TUIs (from within a TUI!)
  * Check out Adam's blog for more info
  * TUIs are awesome for remoting, no context switching, and more!
* Update on PowerShellGet 3.0
  * Focused efforts on PowerShell Gallery since our outage in October
  * Now, focus is back on PowerShellGet 3.0, planning for new preview release in March
  * Targeting late Spring / early Summer to ship in PS7,
  * Targeting mid- / late summer to GA
  * Top considered post-GA features for 3.1 may include NuGet dependency support
* Next RC for SecretManagement targeting first week or two of March
  * Last RC release was in January
  * Based on customer feedback, decided to add secret metadata as a feature before we GA
  * That metadata feature will be included in the next RC release
  * Hoping for GA in April-ish timeframe
