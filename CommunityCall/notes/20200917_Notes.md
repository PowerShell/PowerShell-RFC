* PowerShellGet update
* SecretManagement update
* Notebooks
* Q&A

## Notes

* Release of PS 7.1 preview 7
  * last preview before RCs start
  * made some calls on which experimental features will "graduate" to stable with some remaining experimental
  * RCs will be "go live", which means that they are supported in production
  * first RC this month, second RC in Oct, GA in Nov
  * last chance to give critical feedback before 7.2
* PowerShell 7.2
  * strong desire to use the first half of the previews (6 months) to do feature work
  * second 6 months of release will be oriented more around stabilizing and bug fixes
  * LTS release
  * we want to look more at community contributions for feature inclusion in 7.2 than we have in the past
* Working Groups
  * Think of this as subcommittees that specialize in specific areas of PowerShell
  * Working Groups will
    * foster initial discussions in issues
    * make decisions on feature/bugfix inclusion
    * advise the Committee on RFCs
  * Goal is to reduce bottlenecks within the Committee to providing feedback to feature proposals
  * Creates an opportunity to bring more community contributors on board
* PSReadline list view
  * predictive IntelliSense shows matching lines from your PSReadline as you type
  * You can try this today with PSReadline 2.1.0-beta.2 and TODO link to profile example
  * New list view via F2 shows a list of predictions instead of just the one at your prompt
  * Can also incorporate other predictors, like one for Azure PowerShell that shows ML-generated examples
* Ignite 2020
  * PowerShell 7 and PowerShell Unplugged sessions will be available on-demand
  * 2 Ask the Experts sessions with members of the team
    * "PowerShell and Linux in Azure"
  * 3 PowerShell Table Topics with community and PowerShell Team
* PowerShell Gallery statistics
  * Gallery stats have been down for about a week now, still actively investigating
  * No ETA today, but we will try to provide one soon
  * Completely understand the frustration to package owners
* Intermittent issues in Gallery were reported in the last week or two
  * We recently pushed an update that should fix these issues
  * Please let us know if you're still seeing problems
* PowerShellGet updates
  * Original plan was to try and get PSGet 3.0 into the 7.1 preview releases
  * However, we decided to spend more time ensuring that 3.0 is stable and validated among customers before
    shipping into a stable release of PowerShell
  * Therefore, we will instead be shipping 3.0 for the first time in the first 7.2 preview
  * 7.2 GA will use 3.0 by default (with the 2.0 compatibility module to avoid breaking CI/CD scripts)
  * Major updates to the PowerShellGet repo for planning and milestone tracking
* SecretManagement updates
  * Thanks to everyone for feedback
  * New preview release this week, blog post published on both [the release](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/secretmanagement-preview-3/)
    and the [design changes that impact extension developers](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/secretmanagement-module-preview-design-changes/)
  * Removed the built-in, default vault that was using CredMan on Windows
    * If you upgrade modules, you may need to go directly to Credential Manager to get your secrets
  * This preview introduces `Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore`, an optional .NET-based, cross-platform vault
  * You can still register this new `SecretStore` vault as your default
* Notebooks
  * Notebooks provide the ability to mix rich text and executable code in a single, rendered file
  * In the VS Code PowerShell extension, we added the ability to run untitled, unsaved PowerShell notebooks
  * Files named like `*.Notebook.ps1` will now open directly into notebook mode in VS Code
  * All of this only available today in the PowerShell Preview extension with VS Code Insiders
  * Lots of blog posts available on the PowerShell Team blog
  * Make sure to turn on the Notebook UI feature flag in Settings
* Q&A
  * Separating built-in PowerShell modules from the package and shipping them on the Gallery?
    * We have a strong desire to do this, but our catch 22 is around moving PowerShell forward and
  * Requirement of curly braces with null conditional member access
    * Folks in the community have analyzed the corpus and are arguing that question marks are highly unlikely
      in variable names
    * We can revisit and potentially remove the curly brace requirement in the future based on usage
  * .NET Maui
    * New cross-platform UI framework targeting .NET 6
    * Desire from our side is to work more with `gui.cs` for console GUIs (e.g. better for remoting)
    * Probably don't want to ship Maui in PowerShell itself due to the size
    * We've had a strong desire to do a "GAC lite" where module authors could take a dependency on Nuget
      assemblies that are shared between other modules that need them
  * Could updateable help be provided via the Gallery for other module authors
    * Something we *could* look at, but there's probably less utility there for Gallery-uploaded modules
  * How are we handling the "broken argument passing" in #1995
    * Softening on Start-Process argument list parameters
  * What to do about AssemblyLoadContext and side-by-side modules that are incompatible with each other
    * Module isolation RFC published a while back
    * We'll revisit the RFC with a more hybrid solution depending on PSGet 3.0 for dependency resolution
    * Will be looking at this in 7.2
    * No matter what we do, there will likely be breaking changes for us to move forward here
